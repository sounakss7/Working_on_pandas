# working_on_pandas
Pandas is a powerful and versatile open-source library built on top of Python. Its primary purpose is to make data manipulation, analysis, and exploration easier and more intuitive.
Pandas provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed for working with both “relational” (tabular) and “labeled” data.
Main features:
DataFrames: The central data structure in pandas is the DataFrame, which resembles a table with rows and columns. You can think of it as a spreadsheet or a SQL table.
Series: A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array, often used for representing a single column of data.
Data Cleaning: Pandas provides functions for handling missing data, removing duplicates, and transforming data.
Data Exploration: You can easily explore your data using descriptive statistics, grouping, and aggregation.
